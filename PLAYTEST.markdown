Script for Introduction
-----------------------

Welcome!  Today we'd like you to play through our game Non-Breaking Space.

In our game, you play a pair of space ships and must work together to clear an
asteroid field before time runs out.

Each of your space ships has one faulty thruster and can only turn in one
direction.  Your three-button controls are move forward, turn, and shoot.

Summary of Expected Gameplay
----------------------------

The players will spawn in.  They will take some time to familiarize themselves
with the controls, and hopefully get a handle on them before too much time has
passed.  They will work together to try to clear the field.

The second time around they will get to work more quickly, since they already
know the controls.

Researcher Tasks During Gameplay Round 1
----------------------------------------

Observe the players for:

* Their frustration levels with the controls.
* Strategies they devise.

Note anything noteworthy they say as they play.

Note (roughly) how far they get in clearing the field.

Researcher Tasks During Gameplay Round 2
----------------------------------------

Observe the players for:

* Their frustration levels with the controls.
* New strategies they devise.

Note anything noteworthy they say as they play.

Note (roughly) how far they get in clearing the field.

Note whether they players seemed to improve (in controls and progress) between
games.

* Judge the difficulty of the game.
* See what strategies people came up with.
