Fix the screen-clearing bug.  Add time to end screen.

Player bounciness?

### Problems

Death feels a bit meaningless right now.  The respawn timer punishes you a bit
for dying, but it's not a large punishment.

No incentive to move -- you can just spin and fire in place.

### Solutions

Death consequences:

* Point loss when you die.
* Longer respawn timer (probably not, it would get boring).
* Having a streak multiplier (would need a way to surface this).

Rate-limit the shots.

Powerups provide incentive to move (to get them), and a reason to not die.
Ideas:

* Rapid shot
* Spread/double shot
* Invincibility

Adding a lose condition if both players die at the same time.
